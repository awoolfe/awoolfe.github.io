*serving suggestions*

The best pasta sauce I've ever made.

## Shopping list:
- Short rib
- Red wine
- Thyme
- Bay leaf
- Carrots
- Celery
- Onion
- Garlic
- Tomato paste
- Bone broth (homemade is best, but store bought beef works)
- Cream
- Stracciatella and basil for serving

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Sear the short rib on all sides in a dutch oven with neutral oil.
3. Remove short rib and add carrots, celery and onion and let soften.
4. Add some tomato paste and garlic and cook a bit more.
5. Deglaze with about a cup of red wine, stir, and add all the bone broth.
6. Let the veggies reduce in the red wine and bone broth for about ten minutes before adding back the short rib with the thyme and bay leaf.
7. Put entire dutch oven in the oven and let slow cook for 90 minutes or until beef is tender and cooked through.
8. Remove beef and set aside. Remove bay leaf and thyme and throw them out.
9. Remove the veggies and blend in a blender. In the dutch oven, put in your cream and heat through, then slowly add the veggie mixture until you get a beautiful sauce.
10. Shred the beef with a fork, turn off the heat, and add it back to the sauce.
11. Serve on homemade pasta with stracciatella.

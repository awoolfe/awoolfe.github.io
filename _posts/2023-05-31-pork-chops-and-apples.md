Name a better trio than Pork, Apples, & Beer

## Shopping List
- Pork chops
- Apples OR pears
- Onions
- A beer (chef's pick: kronenbourg 1664 blanc)

## Method
1. Get the pan nice and hot and drizzle some oil.
2. Salt and pepper the pork chops, and sear them.
3. Take out the pork.
4. Throw in thinly chopped onions with the heat down, throw in apples after a bit and cook them too.
5. Toss in half a beer, scrape the bottom of the pan. Drink the other half of the beer.
6. Put the pork chops back in and simmer until beer liquid has reduced.

Serve with rice and rapini.

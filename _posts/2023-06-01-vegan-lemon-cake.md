## Shopping List For the Cake
- 1 ¼ cups unsweetened non-dairy milk
- 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
- Aquafaba (liquid from 1 can chickpeas)
- ½ cup vegan butter, softened to room temperature
- ½ cup canola oil, or melted coconut oil
- 1 ½ cups sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups cake flour OR all purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt

## For the Icing
- 1 cup vegan butter, softened to room temperature
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened non-dairy milk
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

## For the Filling
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- ½ cup non-dairy milk, (such as soy or almond)
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice, (about 2 lemons)
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest, (from about 1 lemon)
- ⅛ teaspoon turmeric, (optional for colour)

## Make the Cake
1. Preheat oven to 350F (175C) and grease and line two round cake tins with parchment (preferably a round piece of parchment that only covers the bottom)
2. Combine non-dairy milk and apple cider and set it aside to become buttermilk
3. In a bowl, whisk your flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and set it aside
4. Drain your chickpeas SAVING THE WATER in a bowl. Use an electric mixture until the liquid is frothy and bubbly. You can't really overmix this.
5. In another bowl cream butter, oil, and sugar. Add in vanilla extract and fold in your frothy aquafaba until combined (I find you get the best texture this way)
6. Alternate mixing dry ingredients with your vegan buttermilk until just combined. A few lumps in the batter are ok but do not overmix.
7. Pour the batter into your tins and bake for 30 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean! Set cakes on a rack to cool.

## Make the Icing
1. While you wait for the cake to cook, you can whip together the icing and lemon curd

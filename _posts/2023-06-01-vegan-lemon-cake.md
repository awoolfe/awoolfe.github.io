*You should only assemble the cake when it is completely cool and the curd has thickened. You can make the curd and icing in advance!*

## Shopping List For the Cake
- 1 ¼ cups unsweetened non-dairy milk
- 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar
- Aquafaba (liquid from 1 can chickpeas)
- ½ cup vegan butter, softened to room temperature
- ½ cup canola oil, or melted coconut oil
- 1 ½ cups sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 3 cups cake flour OR all purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt

## For the Lemon Curd Filling
- ½ cup white sugar
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- ½ cup non-dairy milk
- ¼ cup fresh lemon juice, (about 2 lemons)
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest, (from about 1 lemon)
- ⅛ teaspoon turmeric, (optional for colour)

## For the Icing
- 1 cup vegan butter, softened to room temperature
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened non-dairy milk
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

## Make the Cake
1. Preheat oven to 350F (175C) and grease and line two round cake tins with parchment (preferably a round piece of parchment that only covers the bottom)
2. Combine non-dairy milk and apple cider and set it aside to become buttermilk
3. In a bowl, whisk your flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl and set it aside
4. Drain your chickpeas SAVING THE WATER in a bowl. Use an electric mixture until the liquid is frothy and bubbly. You can't really overmix this.
5. In another bowl cream butter, oil, and sugar. Add in vanilla extract and fold in your frothy aquafaba until combined (I find you get the best texture this way)
6. Alternate mixing dry ingredients with your vegan buttermilk until just combined. A few lumps in the batter are ok but do not overmix.
7. Pour the batter into your tins and bake for 30 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean! Set cakes on a rack to cool.

## Make the Lemon Curd
1. While you wait for the cake to cook, you can whip together the icing and lemon curd
2. For the lemon curd, zest 1 lemon and squeeze 2 lemons and set aside
3. Whisk the sugar and cornstarch in a small pot, then add the milk, lemon juice and lemon zest (and an optional pinch of tumeric for colour), whisking until the sugar is completely dissolved
4. Whisk the mixture over medium heat continuously for about five minutes, or until you notice it start to thicken. This may take longer than five minutes
5. When it does start to thicken (even if its not completely solid) you can take it off the heat, transfer to a bowl, put plastic wrap over it and put it in the fridge. It should thicken more in the fridge.

## Make the Icing
1. Cream softened vegan butter in a bowl. Add icing sugar, vanilla, and a few tablespoons of non dairy milk.
2. Whip until it looks like icing. If it's too thick, add more milk; if its too liquid, add more icing sugar.
3. Put the icing in the fridge until ready to use!

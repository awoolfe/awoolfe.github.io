*the beauty of the pasta salad is you can add whatever you want*

## Shopping List
- Pasta
- Garlic
- Parsley
- Sweet potato
- Dijon
- Olive oil
- Red onion
- Green onion
- Greek yogurt
- Lemon
- Balsamic vinegar
- Fennel
- Cucumber
- Chickpeas
- Red pepper
- Spinach
- Green peas
- Feta cheese
- Black olives

This is not an exhaustive list, nor do I add every ingredient every time, but I try to go for a 1:1 pasta to veggie ratio. Feel free to add your own twist to it. Grilled chicken would be great. Swap feta for bocconcini. Add bacon. I'm not your mom.

## Method
1. Preheat oven to 375F. This is for the sweet potato "croutons".
2. Cut sweet potato into small cubes, toss with salt, pepper, and olive oil and roast in oven until crispy and delicious-looking.
3. Boil water and cook pasta. When pasta is done, toss with a little olive oil so it doesn't stick.
4. For the dressing, whisk minced garlic, parsley, green onion, olive oil, spoon of dijon, juice from a lemon, greek yogurt, and splash of balsamic vinegar in a large serving bowl. Measure with your heart, but dressing is mostly olive oil and greek yogurt.
5. Cut all your veggies into pretty small cubes and put in serving bowl on top of dressing (don't mix it in yet or else veggies will get soggy).
6. When sweet potatoes are done and pasta is slightly cooled, toss everything together and enjoy!

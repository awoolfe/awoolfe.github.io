*the beauty of these potatoes is that what you can add on is pretty flexible*

## Shopping List
- Potatoes
- Oil (something like canola oil is recommended)
- Butter
- Garlic
- Bell Pepper (colour is up to you)
- Spanish Onion
- Salt
- Assorted Spices (Chilli Powder, Cayenne, and Paprika is recommended)
- 1-2 Egg(s)
- Shredded Cheese (Cheddar is recommended)

Recommended going for a 1:1 potato to other veggie ratio (potato:[pepper & onion]). Feel free to add your own twist to it. I'm not your dad.

## Method
1. Boil potatoes to soften them up: ~10 minutes. Note -> keep pot of boiled water on the side afterwards.
2. Cut potatoes into bite-sized cubes and put on a pan in a lot of oil. Should almost be submerged but this might depend on the size of your pan. Medium-High until looking golden-brown. Remove potatoes from pan and put to the side. If some oil is still leftover on the pan this is ok, but not too much.
3. Add egg(s) to the pot of boiled water until hard-boiled.
4. Turn stove top down to medium and add butter and add the chopped onion to the pan and. Then chopped bell peppers to the pan. Salt accordingly. Then the chopped/minced garlic, followed finally by the assorted spices. Cook until desired
5. Add potatoes back into pan and stir until all is mixed well.
6. Peel shell and chop hard-boiled egg(s) and add to the pan.
7. Add shredded cheese to the top of the pan and cook until melted. (Depending on how well the cheese you selected melts, you might want to cover the pan to make it melt faster.)
8. Remove from stove and serve!

## Method
1. Prep your tofu and rip or cut into bite size chunks. Toss chunks in cornstarch.
2. Fry the tofu chunks in a pan with hot oil until golden brown. Remove and drain on paper towels.
3. Chop ginger, garlic and make a cornstarch slurry with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and 1 tablespoon of water.
4. Remove excess oil from the pan and fry together ginger, garlic and 1/4 cup brown sugar until sugar is melted (around 3 minutes) then deglaze the pan with 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/2 cup of water.
